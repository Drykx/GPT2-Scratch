# Zero-To-Hero-Lectures

To deepen my understanding of large language models (LLMs), I followed Andrej Karpathy's lecture series, "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" (YouTube playlist). I genuinely believe this is one of the best educational coding resources available for learning about LLMs.

To complement his teaching I recommend to read Bishop's book on Deep Learning. In particular the chapters 12 on Transformers
